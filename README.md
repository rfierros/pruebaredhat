Greetings and welcome to the Bike24 Frontend challenge

![UI example](https://github.com/Bike24/FrontendCodingChallenge/blob/main/assets/ui_example.png?raw=true)

## The rules
-   The visualisation above is just a suggestion, it's up to **you** to implement it according to **your imagination**

-   Most parts of our frontend are written in React, so using React for your task is an advantage 

-   Focus on **code quality** and **best practices**

-   We expect some unit- and integration-tests. Use the testing frameworks you like

-   Using **Typescript** is mandatory

-   Provide your code in a github repository. We will execute it locally and may not know which node.js version you have used.

-   Imagine how you would deploy such a app with a **cloud provider,** take some notes in the **Readme**

-   You can use libraries, but maybe we ask why exactly this one

-   Please **avoid** a **single commit** at the end, we are also interested in the commit history :)

_Hint: You will find the products in the data folder_

## The task

**Try to imagine a wild :upside_down_face: product owner approaching you and wanting to improve the shopping experience for our customers. The following requirements are specified*

-   As a customer I want to be able to select products from the drop down list.

-   As a customer I would like to be able to determine the quantity of the product before I add it to the shopping cart.

-   As a customer I would like to be informed when I exceed the maximum number of products and be prevented from entering more than this number

-   As a customer I want to be able to see all my products in the shopping cart

-   As a customer I want to be able to see the unit price in my shopping cart. Optional task: there is a value "taxRate" provided - use it to calculate the gross price for each product.

-   As a customer I want to be able to see the total of the shopping cart at any time

-   As a customer I want to be able to remove products from the shopping cart either one by one or by all at one by pressing the "clear Cart" button.

-   It's not allowed to add more than 10 different product types in the shopping cart. As a customer I want to be able to see a visual representation of how many product types I can still add in a progress bar on the bottom.

-   As a customer I want to see a graphical overlay when I confirm the purchase to know that my order was successful

-   It is not allowed to add a quantity of items to the shopping cart that exceeds the "**maxAmount**" of the respective product. As a customer I want to be able to select the quantity of products with a slider
